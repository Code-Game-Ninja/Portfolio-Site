## 📲 Responsive Design

- `>1024px`: Full desktop view with horizontal nav
- `768px – 1024px`: Tablet-friendly layout
- `<768px`: Hamburger menu, stacked sections, and optimized touch controls

## 🧐 How It Works

1. The **hamburger icon** toggles the navigation menu on small screens.
2. The **Sign In** button stays on the top-right beside the hamburger.
3. Hover effects and transitions add a smooth visual experience.

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Customize `style.css`, images, and content to fit your own profile.
